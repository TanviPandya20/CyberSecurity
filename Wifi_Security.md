# The basic working of Wi-Fi and its types with various types of attacks on it.

## What is Wi-Fi?
Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices such as computers (laptops and desktops), mobile devices (smart phones and wearables), and other equipment (printers and video cameras) to interface with the Internet. 
It allows these devices--and many more--to exchange information with one another, creating a network. Internet connectivity occurs through a wireless router. When you access Wi-Fi, you are connecting to a wireless router that allows your Wi-Fi-compatible devices to interface with the Internet.

## How does Wi-Fi work?
On the technical side, the IEEE 802.11 standard defines the protocols that enable communications with current Wi-Fi-enabled wireless devices, including wireless routers and wireless access points. Wireless access points support different IEEE standards.
Each standard is an amendment that was ratified over time. The standards operate on varying frequencies, deliver different bandwidth, and support different numbers of channels.

## Types of Wi-Fi
1. Personal WiFi
2. Enterprise Wi-Fi

## 1.Personal Wi-Fi
   - Appropriate for most home networks. 
   - When a password is set on a wireless router or an access point, it must be entered by users when connecting to the Wi-Fi network.
   - The wireless access can not be individually or centrally managed. One password applies to all users, and it should be manually changed on all the wireless clients once itâ€™s manually modified on the original wireless router.
   - The password is stored on the wireless clients i.e anyone on the computer can connect to the network and also see the password.
 ## 2.Enterprise Wi-Fi
   - Provides security needed for wireless networks in business environments. 
   - It is more complicated to set up, and offers individualized and centralized control over access to Wi-Fi network. When users try to connect to the network, they need to present their login credentials.
   - This mode supports 802.1x RADIUS authentication and is appropriate in cases where a RADIUS server is deployed. 
   - WPA-Enterprise should only be used when a RADIUS server is connected for client authentication.
